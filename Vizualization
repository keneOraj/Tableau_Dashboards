//This link above leads you to a couple of dashboards that I have created. I always loved puzzles so I was just naturally drawn to dashboards. To me, the fun part of creating a dashboad is the process. The process of getting the data, cleaning and transforming, modelling the data, creating new calculated measures or columns if needed. Doing all that and then finally being ready to created the maps, line charts or whatever visualizations that would be shown in the dashboard is what I love the most. The final visualization and dashboard is just an icing on the cake.
